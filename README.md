Here's a complete step-by-step guide from initializing the project to running it:

Open VS Code and open the terminal (Terminal > New Terminal).

Create a New React Project:
npx create-react-app prism-code-editor

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd prism-code-editor

Install Dependencies:
npm install prismjs prism-react-renderer

If you don't have node modules in your folder the just run :- 
npm install

At last we can see our compiler at 'http://localhost:3000/'
after running 
npm start
